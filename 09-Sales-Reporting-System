/*
EXPLANATION OF THE CODE

Retrieve Sales Data by Product and Region: This query calculates the total sales amount for each product in each region. It joins the sales, products, and regions tables, groups the results by product and region, and sorts the results by the total sales amount in descending order.
Retrieve Top 10 Sales Representatives: This query finds the top 10 sales representatives based on their total sales amount. It joins the sales and sales_representatives tables, groups the results by representative, and sorts them by the total sales amount in descending order. The FETCH FIRST 10 ROWS ONLY clause limits the results to the top 10 representatives.
Compare Sales Between Two Periods: This query compares sales data between two periods (first half and second half of 2024). It calculates the total sales amount for each period, grouped by product and region, and sorts the results by product and region names.

/*
NOTIONS COVERED

Using Column Aliases: Aliases are used for columns to make the output more readable.
Using Arithmetic Expressions: Calculates total sales amounts and performs comparisons between periods.
Restricting and Sorting Data: Orders results by total sales amount and limits the results to the top 10 records.
Using Subqueries: Uses conditional aggregation to compare sales across different periods.
Using Joins: Joins multiple tables (sales, products, regions, sales_representatives) to retrieve comprehensive data.
Group Functions: Uses SUM to aggregate sales data.
Date Manipulation: Compares sales across different date ranges.
